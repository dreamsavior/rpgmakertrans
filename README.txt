RPGMAKER TRANS v2.x README
(C) Habisain 2014

Prerequisites:

IF YOU ARE MISSING MSVCR100.DLL INSTALL THE MS VC++ REDISTRIBUTABLE HERE:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999

Most people will have this installed, but if not, that's where to get it.

Usage:

Simply select the game directory, patch and target directory. If you are 
starting a translation, select the 'create patch' checkbox to create an empty
patch which can then be translated.

RPGMaker Trans will attempt to automatically select appropriately named
patches and target directories. 

Errors will appear in a text box in the GUI. Some errors will stop the
patching process, others will not, depending on severity. Note that if
there are errors, the game may not run even if the patching completed;
check to see what the error is and if necessary try running the patcher
again.

FAQ:

1) What languages are supported?

Only Japanese and ASCII character set languages. Other languages will be
supported eventually.

2) Distributing patched games?

Will infringe copyright, so only do this with permission from the original
creator. Otherwise, distribute the patch. Whilst this still technically
infringes copyright, it is more 'acceptable' than the alternative.
