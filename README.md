# rpgmakertrans
A fork of the abandoned project rpgmakertrans https://bitbucket.org/rpgmakertrans/rpgmakertrans/src/master/

This project focuses on the CLI version of rpgmakertrans and provides an easy way to run or build applications from sourcecode, considering the python version requirements and dependencies used to run this application are very outdated.

## How to run
```shell
cd rpgmakertrans
..\python3.4\python.exe .\rpgmt.py path\to\your\rpgmaker\game
```
